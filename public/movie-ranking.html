<h1>My Favorite Comfort Movies</h1>
<h4>My favorite movies are those I can revisit at least once a year without ever tiring of them. They bring me comfort, transport me to a place of safety, and offer new insights with each viewing.</h4>

<h2>1. George of the Jungle (1997)</h2>
<body>George of the Jungle was one of those VHS tapes my family had on constant rotation when I was growing up, and I absolutely adore everything about it. The slapstick humor, the way the narrator interacts with the characters, and the actors’ genuine enjoyment make it feel timeless. There’s hardly anything in the movie that feels dated, which keeps it endlessly rewatchable. The standout song, “Dela” by Johnny Clegg, wraps me in a warm, cozy feeling every time and is impossible not to sing along to. It’s one of those movies I’ve bought digitally and turn to whenever I need a pick-me-up.</body>

<h2>2. Point Break (1991)</h2>
<body>Point Break is an unexpected pick for me since action movies aren’t usually my go-to. But this one’s an exception because there’s just so much to love: Keanu Reeves, Patrick Swayze, surfing, undercover FBI agents, bank heists, car chases, romance, skydiving, and some serious bromance. It’s the kind of over-the-top movie that’s almost too wild to believe—but that’s part of its charm. It’s a summer rewatch favorite that always leaves me craving a trip to the beaches of California.</body>

<h2>3. Wish I Was Here (2014)</h2>
<body>Wish I Was Here is a Zach Braff film that, admittedly, didn’t achieve the success of his first movie, Garden State. Still, I chose it because it blends comfort with a depth that helps me confront more challenging emotions. The film explores themes like pursuing passion, navigating toxic family dynamics, love, and facing mortality. With appearances by Zach Braff, Donald Faison, and other familiar faces from Scrubs, it brings to mind my favorite comfort show. Plus, it holds a special place for me as the first movie I saw in theaters with my partner, reminding me of that memorable, unofficial first date.</body>

<h2>4. Little Miss Sunshine (2006)</h2>
<body>Another comedy-drama, this film explores themes of finding purpose, chasing passions, toxic family dynamics, communication struggles, and imperfect people. Looking at my list, I realize the movies that resonate most with me are those where the characters feel deeply human and relatable. This one captures the complexities of each life stage—from childhood to old age—showing flawed individuals in all their imperfections. It reminds us that, despite their flaws, people still need love, have love to give, and sometimes, that requires real effort. </body>

<h2>5. The Mummy (1999)</h2>
<body>Another Brendan Fraser classic, this movie is pure action for action’s sake. As an Indiana Jones-inspired adventure, it’s a comforting escape from reality. Mummies, the supernatural, wild stunts, and delightfully over-the-top writing make this film (and its sequel) a go-to for my yearly rewatch—and my favorite pick for long flights.</body>
